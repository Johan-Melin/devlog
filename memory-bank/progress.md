# Implementation Progress

## Step 4: Configure Firestore (Completed)

- Installed Firebase SDK with `npm install firebase`
- Created Firebase configuration setup in `src/lib/firebase.ts` that initializes Firebase and exports the Firestore instance
- Created a Firestore service file (`src/lib/firestore.ts`) that:
  - Implements error handling via a `handleFirestoreError` wrapper
  - Provides test functions for creating and fetching documents
  - Includes a comprehensive `firestoreService` object with CRUD operations
- Created a test page at `src/app/firebase-test/page.tsx` to verify the integration
- Set up environment variables in `.env.local` for Firebase configuration
- Successfully tested the Firebase integration by creating and fetching a test document

The implementation follows a modular approach with proper error handling and TypeScript types. The Firestore service is decoupled from UI components, making it easy to reuse across the application.
