# Implementation Progress

## Step 6: Create Project Management Features (Completed)

- Implemented project CRUD operations with Firestore integration
- Created project management pages with create, view, edit and delete functionality
- Added smart URL structure with unique slugs based on project names
- Implemented public/private project visibility controls
- Created shareable project links with clipboard copy functionality
- Added user profile pages showing public projects
- Created public project view pages at /{username}/{projectSlug}
- Added project management view at /projects/{projectId}
- Implemented unique slug generation to handle duplicate project names
- Added automatic project archiving feature with reason tracking
- Enhanced UI with responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Added proper error handling for all operations with user feedback
- Implemented optimistic UI updates for better user experience

The project management system follows best practices by:
- Properly securing data with Firestore security rules
- Creating clean, semantic URLs for better sharing and SEO
- Implementing proper data validation before saving to Firestore
- Supporting offline persistence for better user experience
- Using TypeScript interfaces for type safety across the application
- Following a consistent design language across all components

## Step 5: Implement Authentication (Completed)

- Created authentication system using Firebase Authentication
- Implemented user registration, login, and logout functionality
- Set up AuthContext provider to manage auth state across the application
- Created protected routes using a ProtectedRoute component
- Added sign-up and sign-in pages with form validation
- Stored user data in Firestore upon registration
- Implemented username uniqueness check during registration
- Added persistence to keep users logged in between sessions
- Set up proper error handling for authentication errors

The authentication system follows best practices for Firebase Auth with Next.js by:
- Using React Context to share authentication state
- Proper handling of loading states during authentication checks
- Redirecting unauthenticated users away from protected routes
- Storing additional user data in Firestore with the same UID

## Step 4: Configure Firestore (Completed)

- Installed Firebase SDK with `npm install firebase`
- Created Firebase configuration setup in `src/lib/firebase.ts` that initializes Firebase and exports the Firestore instance
- Created a Firestore service file (`src/lib/firestore.ts`) that:
  - Implements error handling via a `handleFirestoreError` wrapper
  - Provides test functions for creating and fetching documents
  - Includes a comprehensive `firestoreService` object with CRUD operations
- Created a test page at `src/app/firebase-test/page.tsx` to verify the integration
- Set up environment variables in `.env.local` for Firebase configuration
- Successfully tested the Firebase integration by creating and fetching a test document

The implementation follows a modular approach with proper error handling and TypeScript types. The Firestore service is decoupled from UI components, making it easy to reuse across the application.
