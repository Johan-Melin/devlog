Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, and Firestore

# Architectural Overview

## Project Structure

- `src/app`: Contains Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components`: Reusable React components (to be implemented)
- `src/lib`: Shared utilities and services
  - `firebase.ts`: Firebase initialization and configuration
  - `firestore.ts`: Firestore service with CRUD operations and error handling

## Firebase Integration

### Firebase Configuration (`src/lib/firebase.ts`)
This file handles the initialization of Firebase and exports the Firestore instance. It follows the singleton pattern to ensure only one Firebase instance is created, even in Next.js's development mode which may cause multiple initializations.

Key features:
- Uses environment variables for configuration (secure and deployment-friendly)
- Handles duplicate initializations with getApps() check
- Exports a configured Firestore instance for use throughout the application

### Firestore Service (`src/lib/firestore.ts`)
This service encapsulates all Firestore operations, providing a clean interface for the rest of the application to interact with the database.

Key features:
- Comprehensive error handling with a `handleFirestoreError` wrapper
- Type-safe operations with TypeScript
- Complete CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Flexible query capabilities
- Test functions for verification and development

## Pages

### Firebase Test Page (`src/app/firebase-test/page.tsx`)
A client-side rendered page that demonstrates Firebase integration.

Key features:
- Uses the "use client" directive for client-side functionality
- Implements simple UI for testing Firestore operations
- Demonstrates proper error handling and loading states
- Shows how to manage state for async operations

## Future Considerations

- Authentication will be implemented in Step 5
- Project data will be stored in user-specific collections
- Server components will be used for data fetching where possible
- Client components will be limited to interactive elements requiring client-side behavior
